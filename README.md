# Git based Social Networking Script

A very simple social networking application based on git. Users can create local or remote networks (git repositories), 
post and push their comments to the repositories and like or follow fellow members.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
This script is intended for educational purposes and not to be deployed in a production system.

### Prerequisites

Git is required to be installed in the local computer.

### Installing

Get a copy of the script by cloning the [edx]( https://github.com/palexandri/edx.git) repository.

#git clone https://github.com/palexandri/edx.git

Change to edx directory.

#cd edx

Execute sn to get a list of available commands.

#./sn

The script will create a personalised json file for every network you join holding the total number
of posts, the people that you follow and the likes that you have made.
